# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack
- GuardDuty found that there is brute force attacks with:
 + ACTOR from our "Attack Instance"
 + TARGET to our "Web Service Instance"


# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
- AWS GuardDuty voraciously consumes multiple data streams, including several threat intelligence feeds, staying aware of malicious IP addresses, devious domains, and more importantly, learning to accurately identify malicious or unauthorized behavior in your AWS accounts. In combination with information gleaned from your VPC Flow Logs, AWS CloudTrail Event Logs, and DNS logs, this allows GuardDuty to detect many different types of dangerous and mischievous behavior including probes for known vulnerabilities, port scans and probes, and access from unusual locations. In this case, Guard Duty discovered this attack by using the VPC Flow logs, which have information about traffic going to and from the EC2 network interfaces.
